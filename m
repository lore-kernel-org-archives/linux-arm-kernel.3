You're right, thanks for catching this.

Moving the arm64 patch last would take care of the temporary glitch, but
since it seems we need to take this through one tree (e.g. to avoid
merging it over three cycles) perhaps we can just squash them.

That said, it seems I would need to reverse the logic for HAVE_PWRCTL so
that it is selected by HAVE_PWRCTRL if we think we still need to worry
about new users of HAVE_PWRCTL being adding to other trees.

If we could get this renamed already in rc1, we probably do no need to
care about that though.

Yeah, this one should be fine.

Right. Since PCI_PWRCTL_SLOT will be new in rc1 and there is nothing
selecting it, I think we can just rename this one. At least if we can
get this into rc1 and make sure that the pending defconfig update is
respun.

Otherwise it would indeed need to be user selectable.

Let me respin this. Since this is all quite new, we should be able to
just rip of the band-aid for rc1 and not need to worry about this going
forward.
