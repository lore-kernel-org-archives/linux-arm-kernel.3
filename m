I'll try to reproduce it.

Do you remember what were the HEAD commits for the host and kvmtool?

Sure.

Yes, physical instance.

The hardware value might change in the future. Or the host might be running
under nested virtualization, which makes having a different value likely.  Like
you said above, I don't think it's necessary to get into this much detail here -
the idea I was trying to convey is that userspace cannot set the maximum buffer
size to a value larger than what the physical SPU instance supports.

Sure, I'll change the comment to say that 4MiB was chosen because that was the
default in perf, and not go into more details.
