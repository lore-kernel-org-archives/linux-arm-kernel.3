How does userspace know which operations have already completed
then? (not worried about this bit, just trying to understand)

This part does sound dangerous, not in the sense that I think it's
fundamentally broken, but in the complexity it adds.

I wonder if it's feasible to simplify this by always canceling
any ongoing CLA operations during switch_mm():

Is there an upper bound on how long a single operation can take,
or a guarantee that an operation at least provides a partial result
in hardware?

From your earlier descriptions, it sounds like the CPU is usually
assumed to wait for completion with WFE anyway, so from the
scheduler's perspective, the thread is active while waiting for
the accelerator to complete a job (even if from hardware side
the CPU is powered down during WFE).

If this is how it generally operates, and the accelerator jobs
are usually fast, forcing the CLA TTBR0 to be the same as the
CPU TTBR0 would avoid the entire problem of unmapping the registers
on context switch, but instead let this hook into the same place
as the corresponding iommu_mm_data switch on x86, which seems
to handle this more nicely.

Got it now. I had assumed that the page fault is delivered asynchronously
to the kernel without user space getting involved. In this case, I think
the interface is actually cleaner, though it does add a little bit
of overhead for userspace having to decipher the status.

Ok, got it.
