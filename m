Hi,

> Subject: arm_mpam: Add the class and component structures for ris firmware described

Mangled subject line?


There is a fair intersection between the commit message and what the
patch does, but they don't quite seem to match up.

Some key issues like locking / object lifecycle management
and DT parsing (a bit of which, it appears, lives here too) are not
mentioned at all.

In lieu of a complete rewrite, it might be best to discard the
explanation of the various object types.  The comment in the code
speaks for itself, and looks clearer.

Why expose this here?  This patch makes no use of the exposed symbol.

This description of the structures and how they relate to each other
seems OK (bearing in mind that I am already familiar with this stuff --
I can't speak for other people).

Nit:

(for the paranoid)

_x->garbage.to_free = _x;

(_x is an identifier, not a macro argument.  It can't get re-parsed as
something else -- assuming that there is not a #define for _x, but then
all bets would be off anyway.)

This is not the inverse of the cpumask_or()s in mpam_ris_create_locked(),
unless the the ris associated with each class and each component have
strictly disjoint affinity masks.  Is that checked anywhere, or should
it be impossible by construction?


But, thinking about it:

I wonder why we ever really need to do the teardown.  If we get an
error interrupt then we can just go into a sulk, spam dmesg a bit, put
the hardware into the most vanilla state that we can, and refuse to
manipulate it further.  But this only happens in the case of a software
or hardware *bug* (or, in a future world where we might implement
virtualisation, an uncontainable MPAM error triggered by a guest -- for
which tearing down the host MPAM would be an overreaction).

Trying to cleanly tear the MPAM driver down after such an error seems a
bit futile.

The MPAM resctrl glue could eventually be made into a module (though
not needed from day 1) -- which would allow for unloading resctrlfs if
that is eventually module-ised.  I think this wouldn't require the MPAM
devices backend to be torn down at any point, though (?)


If we can simplify or eliminate the teardown, does it simplify the
locking at all?  The garbage collection logic can also be dispensed
with if there is never any garbage.

Since MSCs etc. never disappear from the hardware, it feels like it
ought not to be necessary ever to remove items from any of these lists
except when trying to do a teardown (?)

(Putting the hardware into a quiecent state is not the same thing as
tearing down the data structures -- we do want to quiesce MPAM when
shutting down the kernel, as least for the kexec scenario.)

Is it impossible by construction to get in here with an out-of-range
ris_idx?

To avoid the callers (i.e., ACPI) needing to understand the internal
limitations of this code, maybe it is worth having a check here (even
if technically redundant).
