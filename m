Yes, that's correct.

Sean,

I looked at the tests we ran overnight and your 2nd patch 
(call_srcu_expedited) brings the latencies back to the original 
baselines on both x86 and ARM.  What would be the next steps?  Looping 
Paul in to make sure the proposal is sensible?

Ok, thanks.

I also realised why the same change didn't work for me earlier. 
Apparently other changes in my tree I made for debugging skewed the 
results.  Sorry again for confusion.
