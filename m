Hm, anything that is dynamically allocated can have it, but anything
that it is embedded directly or in an array cannot, because those
structs cannot grow anyway. So I agree it's not exclusive to the
top-level FLB and FH structs. But I would push back on any a mandate
that _every_ struct in include/linux/kho/abi needs it.

I agree we shouldn't need an ad-hoc *_ser_size field in the parent. But
I don't think the entries are the right place to store the size.

A KHO block set needs the entry size before it can do anything with the
incoming blocks. kho_block_set_restore() uses it to validate each
block's count, and the iterator uses it to locate every entry (index *
entry_size). The entry size is a property of the block set, not of each
entry.

Putting the size in a header on every entry means:

 - The block set has to peek into the first entry to learn its own
   layout, so KHO blocks would depend on the LUO header format of
   whatever is stored in them.

 - Every entry repeats the same value, since all entries in a block set
   are written by the same kernel using the same struct. For small
   entries that is a lot of overhead, e.g. struct pci_dev_ser is 8 bytes,
   so an 8-byte header doubles its size.

 - Nothing enforces that all the entries actually agree.

Instead, I think KHO blocks should record the entry size themselves.
For example:

struct kho_block_header_ser {
    u64 next;
    u32 count;
    u32 entry_size;
};

kho_block_set_restore() would then take the entry size from the
previous kernel and verify that every block agrees. Users of the block
set can read the entry size back and decide how to handle entries
written by an older or newer kernel, e.g. ignoring fields past the end
of a smaller entry. That removes dev_ser_size from struct pci_ser, and
any struct can be stored in a block array without a header or a size
field in the parent.

I also don't think block set entries need their own feature flags. The
struct that holds the block set (e.g. struct pci_ser) already has
feature flags, and those flags can describe extensions to the entries.
For example, an optional flag in struct pci_ser could indicate that
struct pci_dev_ser has a new field appended. All entries in a block set
are written by the same kernel, so the flags would be identical for
every entry anyway. The flags only need to be checked once, before
iterating, rather than once per entry.

If a feature only applies to some entries (e.g. some devices), the
parent flag indicates the field is present and the value of the field
in each entry indicates whether that entry uses it.

The entry size in the block header and the feature flags in the parent
are complementary: the entry size lets the iterator step over fields
the kernel doesn't know about, and the flags say which fields are there
and whether the next kernel must understand them.

Please take a look at this series for how I am extending KHO block set
elements using top-level feature flags:

Ok makes sense. Having protection from accidentally changing the offset
of fields in a serialized struct is a good thing.

I think your idea to have a growable header from the thread basically
means that the header and the ser struct will be 2 completely separate
structs and you will need to user pointer arithmetic to jump past the
header and find your serialized struct. So I think this is probably
moot.
