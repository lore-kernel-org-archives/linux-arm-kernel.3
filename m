I wonder if we should try to get this changed/extended, given that it's
all software? Perhaps RL-EL2 could populate parts of the fault syndrome
that get injected back into the host?

Ideally, we'd run something at RL-EL2 that is tightly-coupled with KVM
and so we wouldn't need to teach EL3 anything as long as it lets the
two talk to each other...

I think we need to retain the exception injection behaviour, for two
reasons:

1. The kernel can over-read strings via load_unaligned_zeropad(). If
   this happens to walk into a protected page, we have to inject a fault
   so that the exception handler can fix things up. Otherwise, we'd
   silently poison protected pages due to software-speculative accesses.

2. If the fault comes directly from userspace (e.g. because of an
   out-of-bounds access or a virtio problem), the fault handler in the
   kernel will inject a signal back to userspace which can be caught and
   handled synchronously. I suppose we could require the VMM to make the
   guest memory PROT_NONE if it wanted to preserve this behaviour
   (assuming it doesn't break GUP). Still, it feels desirable to report
   the problem synchronously when we can.
