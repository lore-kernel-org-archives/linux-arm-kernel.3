That's my understanding of the drm_bridge_connector too.

Not sure I got what you mean.

Currently drivers "opt-in" by:

 1. passing DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR to drm_bridge_attach()
 2. instantiating a drm_bridge_connector via drm_bridge_connector_init()

Do you suggest changing that, so 1 and 2 are done transparently if the
driver sets a new flag?

I proposed that, not because I "want" that but because for hotplug we need
a way to know whether a DRM video pipeline is complete in the hardware or
not. This is used in patch 36:

	/* Add the connector if the pipeline is now complete */
	if (drm_bridge_connector_pipeline_is_complete(bridge_connector))
		drm_bridge_connector_add_connector(bridge_connector);

In other words, on a hotplug event (some new hardware was added), check
whether the card is now complete _in the hardware_, and if it is create a
drm_connector.

In this series I proposed implementing it via a new .is_tail callback, that
has been rejected during Dispaly Next Hackfest [0].

The idea that popped up there was that bridge drivers could expose the
fwnode handler to the port@<N>/endpoint pointing to the next bridge. I
liked the idea but then I realized it would hardly fly in complex cases
like bridges with dual-LVDS-or-two-single-LVDS output, e.g. SN65DSI84.

So Maxime proposed [1]:

 ) Thanks for the notes, I think I largely agree with the discussion.
 ) Reading through it, I thought it would be nice for a new callback called
 ) get_next_bridge or something that would return either an error, NULL or =
a
 ) (refcounted) pointer to the next bridge in the chain. And have some kind
 ) of special error (ENODEV?) when the bridge should be there but isn't
 ) (and thus the chain isn't complete).

To me, "Making bridges aware if they are the last in the chain or not" is
not a goal. It is just a technique to implement
drm_bridge_connector_pipeline_is_complete().  I'm happy to implementing it
in a different way if you have better ideas, but I haven't.
