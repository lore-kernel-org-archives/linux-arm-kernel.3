Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

Yes, you're right. But for 2.5 days of work it isn't too shabby :-)

And I think this will help make the 2 seconds much smaller as well later
down the line since we can now find out if a given page is reserved in a
few operations, and do it in parallel.

The descriptor is used on _every_ level of the table, not just the top.
So if we use virtual addresses, at serialize time we would have to walk
the whole table and covert all addresses to physical. And __va() does
not seem to be doing too much. On x86, it expands to:

    #define __va(x)			((void *)((unsigned long)(x)+PAGE_OFFSET))

and on ARM64 to:

    #define __va(x)			((void *)__phys_to_virt((phys_addr_t)(x)))
    #define __phys_to_virt(x)	((unsigned long)((x) - PHYS_OFFSET) | PAGE_OFFSET)

So only some addition and bitwise or. Should be fast enough I reckon.
Maybe walking the table once is faster than calculating va every time,
but that walking would happen in the blackout time, and need more data
on whether that optimization is worth it.

I suppose yes. Though the masks need to be shifted by page order so need
to be careful. Will take a look.

I am guessing you mean to store the order in the table descriptor
itself, instead of having a different table for each order. I don't
think that would work since say you have a level 1 table spanning 128
MiB. You can have pages of different orders in that 128 MiB, and have no
way of knowing which is which. To have all orders in one table, we would
need more than one bit per page at the lowest level.

Though now that I think of it, it is probably much simpler to just use
khomem_desc_t orders[NR_PAGE_ORDERS] instead of the xarray.

Agree. I hope Changyuan's next version fixes it. I didn't really touch
any of these functions.

Nope. This isn't storing the pointer to the descriptor, but the _value_
of the descriptor -- so it already contains the physical address of the
level 4 table.

Same as above. tables contains the _values_ of the descriptors which
already have physical addresses which we turn into virtual ones in
khomem_table().

I didn't see any need for KHOSER stuff here to be honest. The only time
we deal with KHO pointers is with table addresses, and that is already
well abstracted in khomem_mkdesc() (I suppose that can require a
khomem_desc_t * instead of a void *, but beyond that it is quite easy to
understand IMO).
