It's been the whole tone of the reviews, so I'm sorry if you were caught
in the crossfire and you didn't mean that. And I'm sorry it made your DT
maintainership work harder than it already is.

I do mean what I said before though. I have no problem changing the
binding the way you want, but I need to know what to change in the first
place, otherwise it's really no better than a NAK, or we're bound to
have the same exchange for the v2, and I'd rather not.

I indeed missed your question, but now I'm not sure I understand what
you mean by "paremeterize that in DT"? The supplies in the binding are
an aggregate of all the possible supplies a panel can take. They are not
a wildcard, but they all have their own semantics that are used by
panels right now.

I don't expect any new supply to be introduced, unless there's a major
panel technology change such as the one we had with the introduction of
OLED.

Would you prefer to reduce the number of supplies to the minimum we need
right now, and extend it as needed?

Maxime
