I think the comments are correct. I guess it depends on which way you 
look at this: for P030 etc, starting from the lowest bit, the order is 
Cb:Cr. For X403, starting from the lowest plane, the order is Cb:Cr. And 
that's probably how Xilinx HW "sees" it and thus they use the same Cb:Cr 
order.

But in the comments we describe P030's components starting from the 
highest bit, and thus it's Cr:Cb.

So... While the Cb:Cr order can be seen both ways, perhaps the Q formats 
are a good reference here to follow, and thus it should be "430", not 
"403", as you suggest. As for the letter... Anything that's not 
currently in use is fine for me =).
