Only if the objects in the slab cache are of a format that doesn't
change, and I am not sure if that is the case anywhere. Maybe a driver
written with KHO in mind would find it useful, but that's way down the
line.

Agree with both points.

I don't imagine it would be that invasive TBH. memblock_free_pages()
already checks for kmsan_memblock_free_pages() or
early_page_initialised(), it can also check for kho_page() just as
easily.

Yes, and those can work quite well with table + bitmaps too.
