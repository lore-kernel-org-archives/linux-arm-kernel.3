Yup, it is in seconds. I will update the help text.

I didn't think about out-of-tree builds. Thanks for catching it.

I will add a command line option to pass the path of kvm selftests
executable, with the assumption of same directory structure as in-tree
builds. Default will be assuming in-tree builds.

Instead of removing timestamp, I can just print HH:MM:SS, I think it
provides value in seeing how fast runner and tests are executing.

I will modify PID to print each test pid.

INFO will go away.

I will add color+bold for test which fails, timeouts, or skips.

You mean some command line options like:
	testrunner --print-passed --print-failed
	testrunner --print-skipped
	testrunner --print-timeouts
	testrunner --quiet

I can provide few options in the first commit, and then later we can
extend it based on usages.

I can add a sticky bottom line which prints the current state of the
total, passed, failed, skipped and timeouts.

This will be very involved feature, lets punt it to a later versions, if

We can provide user an option like:
	testrunner --output result_TIME

then internally runner will replace TIME with the current time?

If user doesn't provide _TIME then we can overwrite the directory
provided.

This sounds reasonable to me, what do you think?
