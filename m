I fully agree.

A few changes to each bridge wanting to support hotplug will unavoidably be
needed. The .get_next_bridge callback we mentioned in the discussion for
patch 30 at least. I'm keeping any other changes, if any, to a minimum.

That's the idea I had reached too, yes. Except the "bunch of helpers and
hooks" could be perhaps as small as one single helper function or little
more.

Good.

OK, let's see what I can come up with in v2.
