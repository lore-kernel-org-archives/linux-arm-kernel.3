Well, y'all screwed up then.  I don't see why past mistakes should force other
subsystems to support a flawed implementation.  Learn from the mistakes, add v2
of serialization for memfd, and move on.

I guess maybe we have a different definition of ABI? 

I'm not saying that upstream has to be 100% forwards and backwards compatible.
I'm saying the serialization payload itself should communicate what features are
effectively required.  I.e. *if* there are incompatibilities, they should be
naturally expressed in the serialization format, not communicated out-of-band
through magic numbers.

The scenario you describe fits exactly with what I am proposing.  Until something
actually starts using the new sealing flag, the CSP can downgrade to older kernels
at will.  And if the user cares about downgrading, then they need to prevent the
flag from being used until the new kernel is rollback-safe and deployed to enough
hosts to prevent stockout.

Why on earth would we have version numbers in the first place?  IMO, monotically
increasing version numbers are flat out the worst way to communicate features.

I am completely against supporting any scheme that relies on magic version numbers.
It creates problems where none need exist, and checking for compatibility can't be
sanely done in a programmatic way, because by definition it relies on magic numbers.

E.g. if the ABI for a given component hasn't changed, why should anyone care if
the overall "version" of the kernel is ahead or behind by N kernels?

And?  Adding a compatibility layer to a future kernel so that it understands an
incoming HugeTLBFS payload should be trivial.  I can totally see not wanting to
support serializing a post-HugeTBLFS kernel's memory representation into the "old"
format, though even that probably wouldn't be all that difficult.

In what way is providing strong ABI guarantees for individual components
constraining HugeTBLFS serialization?

That's a bit of a strawman argument.  Is designing a forward-looking ABI easy?
No, but IMO "a year" is a massive exaggeration of the effort required to come up
with a scheme that can survive a variety of plausible upgrade/downgrade scenarios.

And again, I'm not saying we have to support infinite compatibility.  If some
future kernel drops HugeTLBFS, and we decide not to provide a shim to support
downgrading (which IMO is totally reasonable), then it's on the user to understand
that moving to that new kernel is a one-way street.  Given that dropping something
like HugeTLBFS would require significant changes in the software stack, I think
it's perfectly fine to put the burden of understanding the implications on the end
user (though realistically, there would be a copious amount of documentation and
deprecation warnings).

Hard NAK.  There will inevitably be boundaries that cannot be crossed, but I am
not at all ok punting on downgrades.  To me, that's basically saying "we want to
add just enough support upstream so that it's not too painful to carry full support
out-of-tree".  That completely goes against the spirit of open source and upstream
Linux, and I want no part of it.
