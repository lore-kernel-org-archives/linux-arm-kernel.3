Hi, Leo

Thanks for the feedback — that makes sense. Here's my updated plan:

For dirty-bitmap mode: allocate a full page for each HDBSS buffer. That
means 512 entries on 4KB pages, or 8192 entries on 64KB pages. We can
use it all.

For dirty-ring mode: the user's ability to configure the ring size is
already gated by kvm_dirty_ring_get_rsvd_entries():

```
kvm_vm_ioctl_enable_dirty_log_ring()
     -> kvm_dirty_ring_get_rsvd_entries()
         -> kvm_cpu_dirty_log_size()  /* returns HDBSS entry count */
```

Since we can make kvm_cpu_dirty_log_size() return at least PAGE_SIZE /
sizeof(u64) entries, the ring size check will naturally ensure that the
dirty ring is large enough for a full HDBSS flush. This way we avoid
wasting memory, and also guarantee that both the dirty ring and the
HDBSS buffer can be flushed properly.

On the ioctl: based on the analysis above, I still think we should not
expose an ioctl for userspace to configure the HDBSS buffer size. It
should be fully determined by the kernel. Exposing it would create an
unnecessary dependency on the dirty ring size and complicate the
implementation.

Thanks!
