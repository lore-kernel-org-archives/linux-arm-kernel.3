I have tested this on :
 - dwmac-socfpga w/ Lynx, SGMII and 1000BaseX mode
 - dwmac-socfpga w/ RGMII mode
 - stm32-dwmac (on stm32mp157a), w/ RGMII mode

I don't have any device available with stmmac using the internal PCS
implementation, but at least the 2 platforms above don't regress with
this series.
