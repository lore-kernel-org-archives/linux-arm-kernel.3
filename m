This looks like a better way of representing state, thanks! I think
"valid" now makes more sense.

I agree it's much better if we can allocate from a sleepable context,
however I see a few concerns in this case:

1. It needs to happen before kvm_fault_lock(), where some of the fault
   information is still unknown, mostly the THP adjustment is not done
   yet.

2. The nested kvm_s2_mmu array, which contain the maple trees, could be
   freed without holding mmu_lock (kvm_vcpu_init_nested()).

3. If we use RCU, we still can't preallocate with a sleepable flag
   because we would be holding rcu_read_lock().

4. Caching maple tree state while holding rcu_read_lock() and try
   preallocating after dropping the lock would also not work, because
   mas_preallocate() walks the tree therefore it must be protected from
   tree writers. And also (2.).

From the above, I don't think sleepable preallocation is feasible, at
least without invasive changes. Even if we somehow solve problem 2.
above, we'll probably need a new stateless preallocation API from the
maple tree (to avoid walking the tree without any locks), or start using
an external sleepable lock for the maple tree.

With this information, would the current no preallocation approach be
preferrable, or do we want to pursue sleepable preallocation anyway?

Sure, this is doable.
