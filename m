For example:
Sharing the TLB between the two SMT threads of the same physical core can
reduce hardware cost while increasing the effective TLB coverage.
A local TLBI take effect on the whole TLB shared by the two SMT threads,
with the sharing enabled by CnP.

In this scenario, enabling CnP in KVM appears to break the guarantee that
TLBs are private to each vCPU when multiple vCPUs of the same VM run
concurrently on different SMT threads of the same PE.
