We can't, but there are a few points to our advantage, namely the boot 
cpu isn't actually affected by this (when the CYC_OVRD bits are not 
configured or not supported), and first round of patching happens quite 
early before the other cpus are started.

This is a good idea.

We also considered using nohlt, however this doesn't disable the use of 
wfit in __delay (which I confirmed to also lose register state with 
sufficiently long timeout values), and it would prevent us from enabling 
a psci based idle later. So it seems a new parameter is needed.

> In fact, would wfe be a better choice than nop for you?

Regarding wfe: Simply replacing the wfi with wfe on these particular 
machines leads to them getting stuck in the boot process (entering wfe 
on the boot core and never waking up again), maybe because some kinds of 
interrupts do not count as as events for the wfe wake-up?
