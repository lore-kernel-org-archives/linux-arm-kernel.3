Fair, but people would not avoid reviewing your new version due to a 
checkpath/etc issue. It's common to just report/ignore that and go on with 
the code that matters. 

Also, checkpath is a good example of what you can run in your code before 
sending, so it does not become a respin.

It's okay. Been there as well :)

Don't worry on this. Previous reviewers can just ignore the e-mail if 
they don't find it interesting anymore.

I would say none. It's just a change suggestion to your patch, made by a 
reviewer. 

IIRC 'Suggested-by' is used if someone suggested the idea for the patch, 
such as "ah, you should do this thing before", etc. It's both for giving 
credit and showing people the idea for that was not yours, for multiple 
reasons.

Good! 
If you get too excited, I suggest reading other people's patches. Everybody 
makes mistakes, and the solutions / suggestions are really interesting :)

It's not bad, the process just goes like that for everybody.
It's just slower than people expect :)

We get slightly better over time, but still make mistakes.
(And try our best not to make the same mistakes again :)

Thanks for contributing!
