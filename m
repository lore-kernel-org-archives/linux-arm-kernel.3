If guest_memfd picks up support for another feature that might lead to
memory being unmapped from stage 2 without userspace initiating it, would
you be ok with that feature being gated by another guest_memfd flag?

I get the feeling we're all on the same page, that guest_memfd will support
a mode where memory isn't unmapped from stage 2, and right now the
discussion is more about how that will be implemented.

Thanks,
Alex
