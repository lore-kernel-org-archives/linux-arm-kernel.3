Many thanks, I got your idea.

So the whole story is that we should let GICD_TYPE.num_LPIs as a
writable field, and set this field from VMM(e.g. QEMU). And it will
be failed if doing migration between VMs with different num_LPI
configurations. After above done, this errata could be added.

Not sure my thought above is right? I will try to prepare a num_LPIs
writable patch if the direction is right.
