Thanks for tracking this down! It was also on my list of things to look
at.

I think we can be a bit more clever than a indiscriminate sleep. If we
set the shadow load enable bit in the disable sequence, we should be
able to wait for this bit to be cleared by the hardware. All the DMA
parameters (presumably including the enable state) should be applied by
the hardware when this bit is cleared.

I guess the read_poll_timeout in lcdif_disable_controller() was
supposed to do exactly that wait, but as it was actually copied from
the mxsfb driver, it's not working as intended. It's my understanding
that the old lcdif HW only cleared the enable bit once it is actually
done, but on the lcdifv3 on i.MX8MP those states are double buffered,
so the bit in the register would be cleared instantaneously, rendering
the wait in the current code a no-op. The only reliable indicator to
see if the HW has updated it's internal state is to set the shadow load
enable bit and wait for it to be cleared.

>=20
This hardware doesn't support async commits. All DMA state changes are
applied during vblank when the shadow load enable bit is set.
