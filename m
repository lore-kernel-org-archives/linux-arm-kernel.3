Of course. I think it's very useful that we're having this conversation
now, instead of when the patches hit the list, I think I didn't manage to
convey that properly in my reply.

I totally forgot that SPE might write a partial record following a buffer
management event :/

I don't think KVM should implement a buffer unwinder, and I do agree that
expecting userspace to do it would further reduce the appeal of supporting
SPE in its current form.

This is how I see SPE being implemented:

* The VMM sets the interrupt number and SPE instance when it enables SPE
for a VCPU. Setting the SPE instance is mandatory, similar to the strict
PMU mode that is being proposed; SPE won't have a non-strict mode.

KVM will enforce this.

* The VMM creates the memslots that represent memory for the buffer
using guest_memfd created with GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_MMAP. Create it with
GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_INIT_SHARED and it looks a lot like an anonymous file, so
I assume that it doesn't require too many changes in the VMM.  guest_memfd,
with this patch [1], guarantees that memory won't be unmapped unexpectedly
from stage 2.

This will be documented API by KVM; KVM will not enforce it.

* The VMM should pre-map memory at stage 2 before the VM is first run. To
do this, it will use KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY [2].

Same as the guest_memfd part, documented, but not enforced by KVM.

* When it comes to migration, the first step is to allow guest_memfd-backed
memslots to have dirty page logging enabled when the guest_memfd file has
been created with GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_MMAP; this is what the series is trying
to achieve.

As for the internal KVM bits, it's mostly context switching the registers
and injecting the SPE maintenance interrupt.

Considering that living with SPE permission faults while migration is
taking place is not possible without userspace implementing a buffer
unwinder, how do you feel about having the VCPUs return to userspace from
KVM_RUN? Do you think that's an acceptable approach and something that
might make migration at least functional?

I'm really not expecting SPE virtualisation to start being widely used, at
least not in the current state of the architecture (requesting that the
entire VM memory is pre-mapped kills most of the use cases), what I'm
hoping for is that SPE will be useful in some limited scenarios, and for
development.

Another option would be to make migration incompatible with SPE, which
means dropping the changes to guest_memfd proposed by this series.

0 minutes sounds like a good thing, or am I misunderstanding something?
