According to current Matthew's plan [1] vmalloc is misc memory :)

Ok, let's stick with memdesc then. Put aside the name it looks like we do
agree that KHO needs to provide a way to preserve memory allocated from
buddy along with some of the metadata describing that memory, like order
for multi-order allocations.

The issue I see with bitmaps is that there's nothing except the order that
we can save. And if sometime later we'd have to recreate memdesc for that
memory, that would mean allocating a correct data structure, i.e. struct
folio, struct slab, struct vmalloc maybe.

I'm not sure we are going to preserve slabs at least at the foreseeable
future, but vmalloc seems like something that we'd have to address.

I was cheating to some extent but not that much. I preserved order in
kho_mem_info_t and if the folios next to each other were of different
orders they were not merged into a single maple tree node. But in case all
memory is free and not fragmented my understanding is that buddy will
allocate folios of the same order next to each other and so they could be
merged in the maple tree.

I believe that even with optimization of bitmap scanning maple tree would
perform much better when the memory is not fragmented. And when it is
fragmented both will need to call memblock_reserve() similar number of
times and there won't be real difference. Of course maple tree will consume
much more memory in the worst case.
