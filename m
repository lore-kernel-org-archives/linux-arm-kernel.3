It's the same as what I understand.

The local_irq_disable() here is pair with the local_irq_enable() in
preempt_schedule_irq(). So I think it is not correct to replace them
separately.

The pseudo NMI does not consider how to do local_irq_disable() /enable()
when the interrupt is masked by the DAIF.I bit as I reported before.
