I think we expect it to be expensive, but since we already clean the 
dirty-bit (ro/rw) bit, we can have both happening in the same write :)

(since we only mark the DBM bit when we fault the memory on lazy-splitting, 
we are expecting to have the same amount of writes to pagetable as we have 
before HDBSS, both on faulting and 1st iteration cleaning)

Oh, that seems more likely :)

Question: is tha above amount of memory initially in Level-1 blocks, 
level-2 blocks or level-3 pages? (aka: were you using explicit/transparent 
hugepages?)

Agree, but see the comment above about using the same write that already 
exists, then we are not supposed to see much of a change.

Thanks!
