That's fair, I was really just trying to understand the direction. It
sounds like you will *eventually* move to FEAT_NMI, even if it's many
years away.

I'm somewhat trying to predict the future here, but I wouldn't be
shocked if some whizz-bang new architecture feature interacted badly
with SDEI, either due to outdated specs or because of a fundamental
incompatability. In this case, I would like the option of being able to
make new hardware support mutually exclusive with SDEI rather than try
to hack around the mess. It sounds like that would be ok for you?
