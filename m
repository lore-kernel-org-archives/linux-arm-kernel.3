Yes, probably :-) My main concern here is making sure we're not
cornering ourselves.

That would work in this case, but if we have a board where the I2C lines
are really not routed, we would have to invent a fake connection to an
I2C controller. That's not very nice.

There seem to be precedents for devices that can be controlled through
either I2C or SPI. See for instance
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/nfc/st,st-nci.yaml that defines
two compatible strings for the same device, "st,st21nfcb-i2c" and
"st,st21nfcb-spi". I don't know if that's the best practice recommended
by the DT maintainers, or a hack that slipped through.
