It's a bit better and it's not a part of FDT which Jason was so much
against :)

Until we all agree that we are bypassing memblock_reserve() and
reimplementing memory map and free lists initialization for KHO we must
minimize the amount of memblock_reserve() calls. And maple tree allows
easily merge ranges where appropriate resulting in much smaller amount of
ranges that kho_mem had.

It's more than 200 line longer than maple tree if we count the lines.
My point is both table and xarrays are trying to optimize for an unknown
goal. kho_mem with all it's drawbacks was an obvious baseline. Maple tree
improves that baseline and it is more straightforward than the
alternatives.

As I said, this means an alternative implementation of the memory map and
free lists, which has been and remains quite fragile.
So we'd better start with something that does not require that in the
roadmap.
