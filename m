I don't understand this one...

I think merging compatibles is orthogonal to splitting SoC and board
DTs. Doug needs to merge because there is more than 1 SoC version or
base DT to pick. In many cases (SoC revision compatibles are the
exception upstream), there is only 1 SoC DT and N board DTs. So we
should consider both and define them separately. In the simple case,
you'd have something like:

SoC (incomplete) compatible: "socvendor,mysoc"
Board overlay compatible: "boardvendor,myboard-rev1",
"boardvendor,myboard", "socvendor,mysoc"

Then you just apply the overlay and it overwrites the incomplete
compatible. That works with existing overlay applying (overwriting)
for multiple steps as long as each step is a superset (compatible
list) of the prior steps.

In Doug's case, I think you need code to decide which base to pick and
then fixup the final compatible.

SoC (incomplete) compatible: "socvendor,mysoc-rev1", "socvendor,mysoc"
Board overlay compatible: "boardvendor,myboard-rev1",
"boardvendor,myboard", "socvendor,mysoc"

And then after applying, you do the merge to insert the SoC rev compatible:

"boardvendor,myboard-rev1", "boardvendor,myboard",
"socvendor,mysoc-rev1", "socvendor,mysoc"

You need SoC specific code to know what SoC revision you are running
on, so SoC specific post apply code should be fine too. There's not
any existing bootloader problem because you need code to handle this.

Maybe that fixup will end up being generic enough that it's not
platform specific, but that's an optimization of the implementation.

Well, you could just require duplicating an overlay N times for N
bases, but that doesn't scale

There's also a use case I'm aware of where the base DT is just for a
SoM and then the bootloader applies an expansion board overlay. So it
is not always "not standalone". And of course, this could be combined
with what Doug wants to do.

Note that for any new property (or an incomplete compatible) like
soc-compatible, you will need to consider how we validate it.

There is a proposal here[1]. It's simple, but I do wonder if looking
at the root compatible only is too narrow of a view. An overlay could
target a connector compatible for example.

We kind of have this information in the kernel build already as well.
The requirement for overlays in the kernel tree is overlays get
applied to at least one target at build time. It would be nice for any
solution to this problem to replace those build rules.
