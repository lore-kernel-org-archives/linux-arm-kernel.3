Ish. If we go for that, then we need to update the name.
drm_bridge_connector for something that is neither a bridge or a
connector is not great.

But even then, I'm not even sure why we need to have that "manager" in
the first place. You want to make bridges be aware if they are the last
in the chain or not. Use that property in attach to either create a
drm_bridge_connector instance if you're last, or attach the next bridge
if you aren't.

And when a bridge is removed, drop everything after it in the chain,
drm_bridge_connector instance included.

And the encoder can take care of handling bridge remove and tearing down
the bridge chain itself.
