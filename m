I mean, it was done at a time where bridge hotplug wasn't a thing and
the assumption was that the bridge chain is static. You're now breaking
that assumption, it shouldn't come as a surprise that it might break
other things.

And I know that you have experienced it already, which makes your
reaction even more surprising to me :)

drm_bridge_connectors bring together a (complete) bridge chain and a
connector. If you don't have either anymore, then we shouldn't keep it
around.

What I was suggesting before was only a suggestion. I guess we could
also make the encoder own the hotplug handling code and create the
drm_bridge_connector when the chain is complete, and remove it when it's
no longer the case.

We can discuss alternatives too. But either way, we shouldn't have it
stick around.
