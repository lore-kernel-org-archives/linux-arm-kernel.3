Actually, this is exactly what we've been doing in our downstream
code[1] for quite a long time. We've even pushed this optimization down
to the individual driver level.

To be honest, I'm not particularly fond of this approach either.
However, on our platform, we have more than 5 Root Port instances that
need to be initialized during boot. When all of them probe
synchronously, it significantly delays the execution of many other
critical drivers. Our customers have been complaining about the boot
time, and our downstream team had no real choice but to kick off a
kthread similar to your suggestion.

The code is very ugly and expose a lot of corner cases problem which
wasted quite lot of time to fix. That's why I was hesitant to bring
up the this approach upstream initially. But since you mentioned it, I
think it's worth evaluating whether we can implement this at the
subsystem level instead of forcing each driver to handle it
individually. This way, the complexity would be centralized, and drivers
that benefit from async probe (like multi-Root-Port SoCs) could opt-in
without worrying about the request_module() deadlock scenario.

What do you think?
