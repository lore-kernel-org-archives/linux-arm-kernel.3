I see Shuai Xue said something in this area, but just to elaborate:

If it's possible that some PE is performing a translation table walk of
the tables being freed, and if a page for an intermediate table gets
freed and reallocated/reused before the TLBI is executed, then HW might
read a garbage value when trying to read a decriptor from that page.
That could lead to a variety of problems (e.g. permit a guest to access
an arbitrary PA, or cause a HW walk to access an arbitrary PA).

Above I had assumed that the S2 table being unmapped+freed weren't live
(e.g. not programmed into any PE's VTTBR) at the time we performed this
invalidation, and hence kvm_pgtable_stage2_unmap_notlbi() could check
some refcount or something to verify that.

If that is the case, all's good, and you can ignore the rest of this
mail. If that is not the case, read on.

If the tables are potentially live on some PE, then it is not safe to
defer the TLB invalidation. However, we can still reduce the TLBIs with
a slightly more elaborate sequence:

(1) Make a temporary copy of the root table (whatever VTTBR points to)
    for the S2 being invalidated.

(2) Clear the entries from the root table (leaving any child
    intermediate/leaf tables as-is).

(3) Perform TLB invalidation for the entire VMID. This will ensure HW
    can't walk to any of the child tables.

(4) Walk the temporary copy of the root table to free the child tables,
    without any TLB invalidation.

(5) Free the temporary copy of the root table.

Mark.
