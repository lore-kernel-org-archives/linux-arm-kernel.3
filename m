In general I would agree with Krzysztof, merged binding means we need to 
stick to it, but in this case I think that would be over the top. As 
Jernej said, there are no users, since we didn't commit on the DTs, and 
the DE33 graphics support in the kernel (bindings and code) is 
incomplete: it's really just the mixer, but no other components (TCON or 
output PHYs) required. So it never worked as such.

In hindsight we could say that we should have never merged the bindings 
without having fully working, reviewed and accepted driver code, for the 
whole display chain. Which we need to do because we create those 
bindings based on reverse engineering efforts, not by looking at 
documentation or design documents (which we don't have).

If you are looking for DT users outside of the Linux kernel, this is the 
result of a quick check (list of users from ChatGPT, checks by myself 
with git clone/git grep):
Zephyr RTOS: no graphics support
FreeBSD: no H616 support
OpenBSD: no H616 graphics support
NetBSD: no H616 support
U-Boot: no H616 graphics support
Barebox: no H616 support
TF-A: no graphics support
OP-TEE: no (Allwinner) graphics support
EDK2: no Allwinner support

Cheers,
Andre
