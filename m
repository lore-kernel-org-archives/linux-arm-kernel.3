Hello,

I presented this series last Friday during the Display Next Hackfest
2026. Here's a summary of the discussion.

The discussion was mostly with Dmitry Baryshkov (major contributor to the
drm_bridge_connector code) and a bit with Paul Kocialkowski and
others. Thanks all!

The proposal to extend the drm_bridge_connector to implement hotplug, and
the general architecture proposed, raised no objection. So I'm going to
continue with this approach.

There were various implementation aspects discussed, which will be my
focus in the coming weeks:

 * The requirement that bridge drivers (the last bridge before the
   hotplug connector, at least) must return -EPROBE_DEFER when the next
   bridge is not present is risky: some drivers might just defer during
   their probe, potentially generating defer loops.

   * Alternative discussed: bridge drivers can expose info about how to
     find the next bridge (the fwnode perhaps) using a new API, keeping the
     existing untouched. Maybe they could also expose the previous driver
     fwnode, even though it currently seems unnecessary.

   * There are various options about how such new API should look like:
     during registration (drm_bridge_add()? too early for some complex
     drivers?), at attach time (maybe too late?) or as a new callback
     (called when?). In all cases this new API would be a superset of the
     .is_tail callback proposed in patch 30, which would then become
     unnecessary.

 * Dmitry asked whether all the attach chain could be entirely moved to the
   drm_bridge_connector for drivers using it. Worth investigating.

   * I did a quick investigation after the event and it would work nicely
     for many drivers but some are tricky. Needs more understanding.

 * The added drm_atomic_shutdown() is wrong, it would stop streaming on
   all outputs on the card. But it is probably unnecessary, just removing
   the connector should be enough.

That's all according to my notes. Feel free to reply in case I forgot
anything or something is wrong. Expect a v2 in the coming weeks with the
above changes, or discussion in case of unexpected issues.

Kind regards,
Luca
