That would result in filenames such as:

  imx6q-apalis-tdx-panel-cap-touch-10inch-lvds-12121000.dtbo
  imx6q-apalis-tdx-panel-cap-touch-10inch-lvds-12122000.dtbo

While technically correct, this creates a usability problem. PID8
("12121000" is what is called a PID8 in Toradex product naming/number
scheme) tracks hardware revisions, including changes that do not affect
the DT, such as passive components or mechanical changes.

A user with PID8 12122001 would not know which overlay to use, and
duplicating identical overlays for every hardware revision makes no sense.

I therefore propose:

imx6q-apalis-tdx-panel-cap-touch-10inch-lvds-v1.dtbo
imx6q-apalis-tdx-panel-cap-touch-10inch-lvds-v2.dtbo

These names match the product names and versions used in our ordering
information, documentation and product labels. Users can easily identify
the correct overlay.

Toradex is responsible for tracking hardware revisions and their software
requirements. If a revision requires a different DT, we can distinguish
it with an additional suffix, and be sure that this suffix is something
that clearly related to the specific product.

This is precisely why we have product versioning and traceability.
Toradex owns and maintains its product definitions, including changes
to internal components. The naming scheme has been designed to handle
these situations consistently.

It is the name of a specific Toradex product, not a generic description.
Together with the vendor prefix and product version, it is unambiguous.

Our DT filenames should reflect the actual products our customers use.

That is exactly why consistent naming matters. The same accessory can be
used across different SoC families. Keeping its name consistent makes
that relationship immediately recognizable.

Internal component details belong in the DT description, not necessarily
in the filename.

This is an existing upstream naming convention, already reviewed and
accepted by multiple maintainers.

Product naming and versioning are the responsibility of the manufacturer
(whatever is raspberrypi or toradex).  I do not think we should
second-guess those decisions without a concrete technical issue.
