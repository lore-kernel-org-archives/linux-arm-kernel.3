Hi David,

Thanks for having a look.

Sure, this is how I changed it:

 };

Hopefully the new name is better.

That's a good idea, will do.

I wanted to make it clear that everything should fit in a u16, I think I
wrote this code before the WARN_ON_ONCE in memslot_to_xa_value() above and
I forgot to change it.

I will clean it up.

Yes, a hashtable search, plus a few more pointer dereferences and an
srcu_read_lock()/unlock() pair is more expensive than accessing the memslot
pointer directly from f->bindings.

Depending on the range, kvm_mmu_unmap_gfn_range() can be quite expensive.
gfn_range->may_block is set, this communicates to the arch code that they
can resched periodically if the range is too big (at least, that's what it
means on arm64, which sleeps every THP sized address range, chosen
empirically as to stop RCU from complaining). Plus, there's also the TLB
flush at the end. My gut feeling is that the extra overhead from how the
memslot is found is insignificant in this case, but I don't have the
numbers to back it up. I can try to get some numbers, if you think that
would be useful?

But that's when there's actually a range to unmap from the secondary MMU.
Let's say there's no range. The invalidations are performed when:

1. The file is closed.
2. Userspace punches a hole in the file.
3. Memory error.

I'm going to assume that the memory error happens very rarely, so it's not
worth to optimize for it.

Userspace closes the file when the VM is being destroyed, does it matter if
it's slightly slower, considering how many other things are usually
unmapped and/or freed during VM teardown? I don't know the answer to that.

As for userspace punching a hole. Two situations here:

(a) No memslots are using the file. I think it's unlikely for userspace to
punch a hole in a file when it's not being used by any VMs (am I wrong?)

(b) There are memslots using the file, but the memory hasn't been mapped
yet by a secondary MMU. In that case, the arch code will still walk the
secondary MMU page tables. Considering that punching a hole also requires a
transition from userspace to the kernel and back, I don't think that the
overhead will be noticeable.

What do you think? Do you think my analysis is correct or have I missed
something?

I'm very willing to consider another approach if you think we can do it
better.

Thanks,
Alex
