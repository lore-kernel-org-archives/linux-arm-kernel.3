Are you referring to the overall UABI or specifically to the ioctl interface
here? I could imagine the ioctl interface evolving before we get this merged
(although it is based on similar patterns used by some DRM and accel drivers -
it's intended to be easily extensible while existing params remain stable).

The aspect where the CLA MMIO is directly mapped into user space is an aspect we
are keen to keep though since it has significant performance implications if we
need to redirect through the kernel.

Note that we are exposing MMIO per CLA, not per accelerator. So preventing
access to a single CLA would prevent access to all accelerators attached to it.
There is a per-accelerator availability masking control that the kernel can use
to disable access to selected accelerators though, which might help with the
vulnerability example.

The rationale for choosing a single device file was driven by performance: At
domain reassignment time, we need to unmap and invalidate the TLB entries for
all the devices in the domain from the out-going process's address space. By
having all the devices in a single file and all devices within the same domain
adjacent, they can all be mapped to a single VMA, meaning the driver can use a
single call to the existing zap_special_vma_range(), which will result in a
single TLBI-by-range instruction, which is faster than a TLBI-by-va for every
device.

If you think it is important for security to have each CLA exposed by an
independent device file, I'll take another look.

I can probably do a better job of explaining this: The kernel keeps a cla_ctx
object which represents a single {file description, mm_struct} context that
wants to use the cla_domain (collection of 1 or more cla_dev). Initially the VMA
is not populated so when user space tries to access, it will fault to the
driver. If the cla_domain is assigned to a different cla_ctx, the faulting
thread is put to sleep until the driver determines that it's the turn of that
cla_ctx to be assigned the domain. At that point the waiting thread(s) are woken
and map the devices from the domain to the VMA and return to user space. The
out-going cla_ctx had it's mappings removed during the reassignment process so
any user space access will now fault and sleep waiting for assignment.

The HW only has a single HW context, hence the timesliced assignment approach
described above (assuming there is more than 1 concurrent user).

In the current code, a process can theoretically create the same number of
cla_ctx as the number of file descriptors it can open(). It would then need to
mmap and access to get into the queue to be assigned the domain. I see it as
similar to threads; if process A creates 10 threads and process B creates 1
thread, then in the long run (ignoring cgroups et al) you'd expect A to get
10/11th of the CPU time (IIUC?).

Do you think this consitutes a DoS?

As per above, I can go look again at having a device node per CLA device (i.e.
one for each CPU that has a CLA). But it doesn't make sense to have a device
node per accelerator (a CLA can have up to 8 connected accelerators); there is
only a single HW interface.

Yes agreed; my mistake - this is used for the internal development versions
where the interface has been changing and I forgot to remove it for the RFC.

I believe this is already correct - I'm reeturning VM_FAULT_RETRY
unconditionally at this point, which is also the correct return code if we get
interrupted. This unwinds to arm64's do_page_fault() which then notices and
handles the fault:

	/* Quick path to respond to signals */
	if (fault_signal_pending(fault, regs)) {
		if (!user_mode(regs))
			goto no_context;
		return 0;
	}

I believe GUP and other handle_mm_fault() callers have similar logic.

I'll add a comment to make that clear.

ACK, I'll fix this.
