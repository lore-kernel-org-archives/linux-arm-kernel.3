as mentioned below, maybe the proper way is to handle it like KVM_EXIT_ARM_NISV. In this
case exit to userspace with KVM_EXIT_ARM_LDST64B, if it's due to the wrong mapping of the
guestOS then reinject the DABT back to the guest, otherwise the userspace need to check
whether it's reporting the memory region correctly and handle in its own way.

you're right, I misunderstand here. If there's no stage-2 mapping we'll have
a translation fault here rather than an unsupported exclusive or atomic access
fault. So no need to check and handle it here since we won't have such a fault
in this case.

yes similiar to nISV MMIO and no ISV as well. Per-spec DABT caused by LS64* has ISV==1
if it's a Translation fault, Access flag fault, or Permission fault, but not for
unsupported exclusive or atomic access fault..

Thanks.
