The required bit is subsystem property not the per-file. e.g. memfd_luo,
it is set at compile time for a kernel. So every file will get that required
bit set. It is not per file property.

struct u8 memfd_luo_feature_state {
       [MEMFD_LUO_CORE_FEATURE] = LUO_FEATURE_REQUIRED
}

IIUC, I believe this will not work.

To Communicate between source and target, We are defining a protocol, A
protocol which will be standard for all the kernel. And each bit location in
flags must have the same meaning in both the source and target kernel.

Now in you approach, If Source kernel send feature N to target kernel,
target kernel must understand Nth bit as the same feature. Even though
the bit position in your approach is not fixed but they are fixed
relative to their starting point.

required: reference is 0th bit: So target kernel will undersatnd the
          bit as the same feature as source kernel.
optional: reference is nr_required: So target kernel will understand the
          bit as the same feature as the source kernel.

To make sure there is harmony between these two kernel. Even though a
bit is not set in required for a feature that must be 0 in required
range. and similarly for optional bits.

So flags will look like 0b 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
                               o o o o o o r r r r r r

                        0b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
                                           o o o r r r <= This is wrong
                                           because target can never know
                                           which bit mean what feature.
                                           So as you said there will be
                                           no gaps which will not work here.

So, Based on the first, We still using same number of bits and increased
complexity and no gain.


For the current appraoch and V3 [2]. Think the below one as msb is
required bit and lsb is feature present in payload bit.

00  FEATURE_ABSENT / DEPRECATED
01  FEATURE_OPTIONAL
11  FEATURE_REQUIRED
10  IS INVALID (analogy: required set but feature is not present) which can
have different meaning in future if in future, a need arises to reuse this
field.

Deserialization can happen per feature from right to left. without
jumping back and forth.

Because of all these reasons, I believe current approach presented in
V3 [2] is the better. It is close to your PCI series with two flags
field for required and optional except I combined both field into one
flags. In your above approach you do have two counts but not having gaps
(which is wrong) and the way you proposed to parse with an offset is different.

Let me know what you think.
