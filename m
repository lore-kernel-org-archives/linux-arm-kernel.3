I think it makes sense to call it shadow in the context you pointed out.
In my context it doesn't make sense because the original structures are
manipulated by the hypervisor while the host only interacts with a copy
(eg. thus the shadow naming).

If you disagreee maybe we can call it a copy, I have no strong feelings
about this.

Right, this will complicate the series a bit. I used the term 'quirk'
because this is how the driver refers to it.

I created a simple driver that registers for MSIs and probed it after
boot complete and observed all the commands sent to the ITS being
handled by the hypervisor.
