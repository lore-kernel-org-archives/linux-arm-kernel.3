I think what's here looks really suspect - regions of two registers
wide, interlaced between devices etc.
You mention syscons here, and really that's where I think that this
should go. The region at 0xf007_0000 looks exactly like a syscon to me
and should be modelled as one.

The regions in the first reg property of the GPIOs I dunno about, it's
hard to say without a full picture of what's around them - but this
device does seem to /love/ smushing devices in in a compact memory map
so modelling them as individal devices is probably correct, unless it
could all be considered to be one big GPIO controller with 4 banks. Hard
to say really, and not very important IMO.

The second register region would have to be looked up via a syscon
phandle, but even that seems incorrect to do in the face of your
explanation of how they're really pinmuxing between gpio and some other
feature, not an internal of the GPIO functionality.

I think it's fine to make a GPIO controller at this point, and leave
pinctrl to later, but I don't think that it is acceptable to pretend
that the mux registers are part of the GPIO controller. The pinctrl-less
GPIO controller would have to either rely on something else (e.g.
firmware) setting the mux registers or be not entirely functional until
the pinctrl arrives - IMO that kind of thing isn't abnormal, it's just
how things can sometimes be. For example, if you submitted a SPI driver,
but no board exposed SPI without pinmuxing changes that were not
possible as the driver for that was not yet upstream, that's not
something that would block the SPI driver. It might, on the other hand,
block adding the SPI node to the devicetree.

Thanks,
Conor.
