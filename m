This is awful, I was able to reproduce it.

I guess I could make it so the memory is kept pinned when the buffer is
disabled. And then unpin that memory only when the guest enables a buffer that
doesn't intersect with it. And also have a timer to unpin memory so it doesn't
stay pinned forever, together with some sort of memory aging mechanism. This is
getting to be very complex.

And all of this still requires walking the guest's stage 1
each time the buffer is enabled, because even though the VAs might be the same,
the VA->IPA mappings might have changed.

I'll try to prototype something, see if I can get an improvement.

Question: if having a large buffer is an issue, couldn't the VMM just restrict
the buffer size? Or having a large buffer size is that important?

Thanks,
Alex
