Sorry about that; thanks for taking a look!

Ok. I couldn'y spot where we prevent placing HW breakpoints on
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() functions, but if we do enforce that, something like
that sounds ok.

I suspect we'd need to make that noinstr to also prevent ftrace
instrumentation, unless ftrace also inhibits itself for
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() functions.

IIUC, it looks like they *can* take debug NMIs during
arch_install_hw_breakpoint() and arch_uninstall_hw_breakpoint(), which
is why they have ordering constraints for modifying the percpu 'cpu_dr7'
variable, and their actual DR7 register (which IIUC has the enable
controls for each HW breakpoint).

That said, the use of 'bp_per_reg' looks suspect given their
arch_install_hw_breakpoint() and arch_uninstall_hw_breakpoint() modify
that non-atomically.

We could consider allowing breakpoints on those functions, but I'm not
sure whether that's possible for us, and (as noted below) it might be
better to transiently disable breakpoints/watchpoints.

IIRC on x86, breakpoint exceptions are taken *after* execution of the
instruction that triggered them, so the handler doesn't have to
manipulate single-step, and can safely ignore a breakpoint exception
without the risk of getting stuck taking the breakpoint repeatedly.

I'd expect that the core perf code disables interrupts before calling
arch_install_hw_breakpoint() or arch_uninstall_hw_breakpoint(), and this
would be necessary for perf to serialise against IPIs that manipulate
the perf_event_context.

I agree that when we actually take the breakpoint, we'll mask all
exceptions, and so it's not necessary to mask IRQs there.

So a first step is probably to add that lockdep assert.

As above, I agree (with caveats), but I couldn't spot where this is
enforced.

If we have to transiently disable watchpoints/breakpoints when
manipulating the relevant HW registers, that sounds fine to me.

Thanks for digging into this; much appreciated!
