Ah, that's close. What I want to say is that it has a direct
correlation with dclk and resolution.

Yes, I think it depends on the strategy you adopt.

I think this is a software strategy for debouncing.

I think it's both. You can think of the VOP internally as having a FIFO:
aclk is used to fill the FIFO, while dclk is used to consume from it. 
This problem occurs when the fill rate cannot keep up with the consumption
rate.

In practice, it is difficult to find a quantitative method to determine 
whether the requirements can be met, so we can only try through 
experimentation. For now, this strategy appears to satisfy our needs.

Thank you for doing this, let's see if others have any comments.
