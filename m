I have a few more questions here. Most of the description and
the design decisions make perfect sense to me, but there are
a few things I don't understand from your current document.

This sounds a lot like st64bv or st64bv0, passing an 8-word payload and returning
a single word per accelerator operation with shared addressing.

Why are there now two interfaces to do the same thing?

Can a user process use st64bv to do the four steps in a
single instruction?

The asynchronous interface seems very confusing.

How are page faults from the SVA master resolved during an
asynchronous operation?

Can a CPU start multiple asynchronous operations concurrently?

Do these continue to run if the starting process is scheduled out
and another process also tries to use CLA?

I would like to understand the faulting part better. Which instruction
specifically causes the fault, is that the poll STATUS read?

Could you give an example what this model might be good for?

Does this mean a user may have to start one operation on each CPU
from a thread of the same process in order to get a result efficiently
across a shared accelerator?

I assume this will become clearer once you can show an example userspace
application that uses this type of accelerator.

Do you have any plans for in-kernel usage of the accelerators?
I would assume that for things like cryptographic features, these
make sense to be exposed to the kernel itself.

What happens if multiple processes have the same chardev open and
each mmap() that, e.g. after a fork()? Does each process see its
own virtual instance of the accelerator and interact with it through
the same physical MMIO register range but its own process address space,
or do you have to rely on the registers being mapped only into a
single mm_struct to prevent a process from messing with another process
data?

I'm not sure I understand this point. Do you mean any async operation
that was started on an accelerator may fail due to preemption, so user
space must be able to restart it?
