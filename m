Awesome, many thanks for doing that!

I'd assume this is a regression test, as your machine uses the standard 
MMIO interface?
If you don't mind, I'd put this tag on the first refactoring patches, so 
01/11 - 08/11, and leave out the remaining 3, as they are about MPAM-Fb, 
which wasn't really tested, I guess? Also patch 10/11 (the error IRQ 
changes) changed, so I would drop all tags from this anyway.

Cheers,
Andre
