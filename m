Folios are not available when we restore reserved regions, this just won't
work.

We don't know how much of the preservation will be based on folios.
Most drivers do not use folios and for preserving memfd* and hugetlb we'd
need to have some dance around that memory anyway.  So I think
kho_preserve_folio() would be a part of the fdbox or whatever that
functionality will be called.

Are they? 
The purpose of basic KHO is to make sure the memory we want to preserve is
not trampled over. Preserving folios with their orders means we need to
make sure memory range of the folio is preserved and we carry additional
information to actually recreate the folio object, in case it is needed and
in case it is possible. Hughetlb, for instance has its own way initializing
folios and just keeping the order won't be enough for that.

As for the optimizations of memblock reserve path, currently it what hurts
the most in my and Pratyush experiments. They are not very representative,
but still, preserving lots of pages/folios spread all over would have it's
toll on the mm initialization. And I don't think invasive changes to how
buddy and memory map initialization are the best way to move forward and
optimize that. Quite possibly we'd want to be able to minimize amount of
*ranges* that we preserve.

So from the three alternatives we have now (xarrays + bitmaps, tables +
bitmaps and maple tree for ranges) maple tree seems to be the simplest and
efficient enough to start with.
 
Preserving folio orders with it is really straighforward and until we see
some real data of how the entire KHO machinery is used, I'd prefer simple
over anything else.
