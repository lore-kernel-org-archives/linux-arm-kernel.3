I'd say the most complex part in Alex's approach was the need to reuse
the tag storage for classic data and kick the pages around when some
other page needs to store tags in there. That approach is pretty much
dead.

In theory, having MTE and non-MTE memory (heterogeneous) without a
carveout reuse would be a bit more manageable - not that far from the
NUMA migration and at least you only migrate the page being accessed
rather than unrelated ones where the tags need to go. But this was not
Alex's goal for Android since people were asking for the reuse of the 3%
carveout rather than a smaller carveout.

Other future deployments, CXL-attached memory etc. may benefit from a
new scheme but I wouldn't rush in implementing anything in the kernel
for now.

The VMM may be in a better position to manage such heterogeneous memory
for the guest if it knows the capabilities of the slots (e.g. some DAX
mmap() vs anonymous mmap()). This would require the VMM replacing a page
within a slot from one memory type to another (while preserving the
data). I don't think we have a concrete use-case yet to be worth the
hassle.

There's some vague wording that general purpose memory should be MTE
capable if FEAT_MTE2 or later is advertised. But that's not well defined
and one can have other types of memory in the physical space (e.g. CXL)
that don't support tags. Last time I looked we still haven't got a way
to describe memory capabilities in firmware.

For the time being, I think a real use-case for FEAT_MTE_PERM is in the
context of cacheable MMIO (there are some patches around from Nvidia to
do this with VFIO). That memory, if exposed to guest as WB and the guest
enables MTE, may trigger some SErrors. With FEAT_MTE_PERM KVM could trap
and inject a fault back into the guest - maybe SEA. Is it easier to do
this from KVM itself or we would rather exit to the VMM and let it
handle? The latter allows room for other fancier things in the future
but the former may be quicker, in the absence of other strong use-cases.

I've never played with libkrunfw. Does it handle inserting a Linux
kernel? Such approach may not work well with MTE. The kernel frees the
init text/data sections back into the page allocator. With MTE
advertised as present, the guest will try to reuse that memory,
potentially as tagged. However, since the VMM mmap'ed the guest kernel
from a file, VM_MTE is not supported in the VMM address space. Even if
the mapping is MAP_PRIVATE and the page copied on write, the vma remains
the original one associated with the file, so VM_MTE_ALLOWED not set.

We could revisit this and allow mprotect(PROT_MTE) to force the CoW on
private file mappings but we'd need some strong requirement for this
(MTE+libkrunfw could be such thing if people need this combination).

To simplify things, I think whatever is presented to the VM as standard
RAM (typically present at the VM boot) should either support MTE or MTE
will be disabled for the guest. For other types of memory, whether WB
MMIO or RAM presented as virtio-(pmem, shm etc.) backed by files in the
VMM, the VM should be aware it is not standard RAM and should not
attempt to enable MTE on it. If it does (either by mistake or malice),
FEAT_MTE_PERM should trap and inject a fault back into the guest (or
kill it altogether but for debugging, I'd rather inject a fault if
possible).
