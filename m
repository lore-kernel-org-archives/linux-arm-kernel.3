Two SMT threads(PE0,PE1) on the same physical core share TLB.

VM0 has 2 vcpus, vcpu0 and vcpu1 that share all architectural context
except the address translation context.

Vcpu0 may observe TLB entries that are supposed to be private to vcpu1
in the following case:

    PE0(core0,smt0)         PE1(core0,smt1)
vcpu0 load           
vcpu0 va->pa0        
vcpu0 put            
                                       vcpu1 load
                                       vcpu1 flush local tlb
                                       vcpu1 modify desc to va->pa1
vcpu0 load
vcpu0 hit *va->pa1*
