At this point, regs->pmr will be the value of PMR when we were executing
in userspace, which should be the value of regs->pmr the last time we
returned to userspace. That should be GIC_PRIO_IRQON, as configured by
start_thread_common().

The entry asm will set PMR to 'GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET', but
that should be reset to GIC_PRIO_IRQON when el0_svc() calls
local_daif_restore(DAIF_PROCCTX).

Within invoke_syscall(), we should have DAIF==0 and PMR==GIC_PRIO_IRQON.

The value in the regs->pmr should be GIC_PRIO_IRQON, without
GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET.

As we don't unmask anything during BRK handling, the live PMR should
contain 'GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET'.

The presence of 'el1_abort()' in the trace suggests that BPF tried to
access memory which faulted. That looks to be a result of
bpf_probe_read_kernel() and copy_from_kernel_nofault().

Regardless of BPF, we can probably trigger a synchronous exception with
a WARN() or similar, so we will need to handle synchronous exceptions
from the same contexts.

In general, probing kernel VAs is fraught with danger even with a fault
handler, and IMO copy_from_kernel_nofault() is a dangerous and poorly
conceived interface. For example, if you're probing an arbitrary kernel
VA, you have no idea whether you're about to poke MMIO and crash the
system.

It would be interesting to know what the BPF program is doing, in case
it could crash the kernel in other ways we can't prevent here.

Only the live value of PMR is important here, and the value of regs->pmr
is immaterial.

The warning is here to capture the fact that if
__pmr_local_irq_disable() were to set PMR to GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF, it would
effectively discard GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET and change the masked priority,
which has a bunch of secondary impacts for things like idle.

We'll need to work through those impacts; we might be able to relax the
check.

> How to fix it? I don't know very well.

The complete fix (which Ada and Vladimir have both been working on) is
to get rid of GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET entirely, which requires structural
changes in a few places/

I don't think we'd realised there was an extant bug of this shape, so
we'll need to consider what we can do to fix this in a backportable way.

I'm not sure what you mean here. PSTATE_I_SET doesn't exist, and I'm not
sure whether you're asking about the PSTATE.DAIF bits saved in
regs->pstate, or the PMR value in regs->pmr.

Regardless of pseudo-NMI, is is essential that regs->pstate holds a
complete snapshot of SPSR, including the I bit.

With pseudo-NMI, it is essential that the full PMR value (including
GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) is saved into regs->pmr.

However, as above, AFAICT only the live value matters here.

I think that might happen to work as a bodge, but I don't think this is
a proper fix, and we'll need a clearer explanation of what's going on.
