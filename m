Sure adding a new requirement (hotplug) breaks the existing design. Still,
this can be solved either by adding a new software component or by
extending the existing software component (drm_bridge_connector) as this
series proposes. None of the two ideas is wrong, so let's discuss which is
best.

Sure, the drm_bridge allocation was not refcounted and needed to be. And we
didn't ditch the drm_bridge to create a new thing, we instead extended the
existing software component (drm_bridge) to also be refcounted.

I definitely agree we don't want to add burden back on the encoder.

>> stick around.

Bottom line, I roughly see three ideas mentioned:

 1. (this series) extend the drm_bridge_connector to create the
    drm_connector based on bridge hotplug events [+rename it]
 2. - keep the drm_bridge_connector (mostly) as is
    - let each encoder driver add/remove it based on bridge hotplug events
    =3D> more burden on encoder drivers -> no
 3. - keep the drm_bridge_connector (mostly) as is
    - add a new component (what name?) that will receive bridge hotplug
      events and react to them by adding/creating a drm_bridge_connector
    - modify encoder drivers to create this new object instead of the
      drm_bridge_connector

In principle option 3 is the same as option 1, except it is split in two
components.

I _think_ you both are discussing option 3. Correct?

If that's correct: any name suggested for the new component?
drm_hotplug_manager? drm_connector_manager? drm_bridge_connector_manager?
