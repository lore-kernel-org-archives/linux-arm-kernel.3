okay will add a workaround for apple on this feature.

nop, but the problem is not about the KVM function itself. The problem is that
trying to use "nvhe" mode on a E2H0 unavailable platform, and doesn't pass the
check of nvhe mode in early_kvm_mode_cfg(), explicitly:

early_kvm_mode_cfg()
[...]
	if (strcmp(arg, "nvhe") == 0 && !WARN_ON(is_kernel_in_hyp_mode())) { // Trigger the WARN_ON here and a call trace in the dmesg.
		kvm_mode = KVM_MODE_DEFAULT;
		return 0;
	}

finally we'll enter with VHE mode so the function of KVM is fine. we want
to eliminate this call trace and notify the user "nvhe" is not supported
due to !FEAT_E2H0.

The helper will be used in 2 places (sorry for the mistake in the last
reply):
1) in the HAS_E2H_RES1 capcap's detection has_e2h_res1()
2) in early_kvm_mode_cfg() for checking HAS_E2H_RES1 support and avoid
   checking for "nvhe".

is it suggested to check the mmfr4 directly in those 2 places without
using a wrapper?

Thanks.
