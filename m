It does, please see the AIPSTZ_OPACR register definition. The imx-atf of
sets OPACR registers to 0 (of course), which means that the S/NS is not
checked _but_ it can be configured.

Also please see chapter 4.7.6.1 Security Block:

The AIPSTZ contains a security block that is connected to each
off-platform peripheral. This block filters accesses based on
write/read, non-secure, and supervisor signals.

Please see above.

No you didn't confused me but you triggered my interest :) and I started
to check the (S)TRM.

We're talking about the IP access permissions, right. If the
"secure-I2C" is accessible from NS world this would make a difference of
course.

I have read this too, also that the AIPSTZ can force the mode into
user_mode regardless of the CSU settings, if I get this correct.

What I don't understand as of now is the interaction of the AIPSTZ and
the CSU. You can configure different bus-masters within the CSU to be
S/NS as well as the pheripherals. Now the part which I don't understand
right now: According the OPACx register description:

x0xx SP0 — This peripheral does not require supervisor privilege level
           for accesses.
x1xx SP1 — This peripheral requires supervisor privilege level for
           accesses. The master privilege level must indicate supervisor
	   via the hprot[1] access attribute, and the MPROTx[MPL] control
	   bit for the master must be set. If not, the access is
	   terminated with an error response and no peripheral access is
	   initiated on the IPS bus.

The peripheral can be configured via the AIPSTZ as well. So which IP
(CSU or AIPSTZ) override the other if the settings don't match, e.g. if
CSU says: "this I2C controller for secure-world" and the AIPSTZ says:
"this I2C is for non-secure-world".

> Given all of this, I think the purpose of this IP's AC is to add some

Or to override the CSU settings like the MPROTOx values:

xxx0 MPL0 — Accesses from this master are forced to user-mode
           (ips_supervisor_access is forced to zero) regardless of the
	   hprot[1] access attribute.
xxx1 MPL1 — Accesses from this master are not forced to user-mode. The
            hprot[1] access attribute is used directly to determine
	    ips_supervisor_access.

Can you pleae elaborate a bit more how NXP designed the interaction
between both the AIPSTZ and the CSU?

Regards,
  Marco
